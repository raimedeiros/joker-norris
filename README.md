# Chuck Norris joke generator 

***This project was made for an interview test.***

The app was inittialy made using React and Redux to match the interview requirements. In 2021, I am rebuilding this app to remove unnecessary dependencies like Redux itself and Bootstrap to use new libraries that works better, faster and make the project cleaner.

This project was made based in the API of [ChuckNorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/), using React.

The app starts listing all the categories available and shows a joke when a category is selected. The joke page has options to generate another random joke or return to categories listing page.
